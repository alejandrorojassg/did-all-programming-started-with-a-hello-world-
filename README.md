# did all programming started with a hello world? 
`hi everyone, this is my first programming course's repo`

------------

just now that i'm writing this up, i wonder what was the first experimental code line, idk, it could be like: 

------> `this is a test(?)`
  
  or just like: 
  
  ------> `does this shi* works?`
  
  we're not probably gonna know it, but these days we know how to start in a common  and easy way
  
  **the code is: **
  
    if __name__ == "__main__" :
      print("Hola mundo")

that's way so easy to understand, but also, currently people in the course don't even know what a `print` means
(i don't really know what's the nature of ` if __name__ == "__main__" :`, btw)

i started with just `print "hello world"`, but i'd say by logic is related to admin privileges.

well, so... then, i wrote that on the default notepad, just like:

after that, i run it in cmd:

the same in the idle(python):

and in VSCode too:
